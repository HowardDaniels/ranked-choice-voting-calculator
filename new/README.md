# note-taker

This server application allows users to write, save, and delete notes, as well as access a log of written notes.

Notes include a title and text which the user writes into two input boxes on the notes page (after clicking the button on the homepage).

The log of notes appears on the sidebar of the notes page once the user clicks on the save icon in the top right-hand corner of the screen.

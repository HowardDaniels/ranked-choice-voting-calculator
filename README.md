# ranked-choice-voting-calculator



This is a ranked choice voting (RCV) calculator.

Ranked choice voting (as used for this application) allows voters to rank up to 3 choices for candidates. If no candidate wins a majority (over 50%) of first preferences, the candidate in last place is eliminated, and his/her voters are reallocated based on their second preference. This process is repeated until a candidate wins over 50% of the vote. Ballots in which all candidates listed are eliminated are not counted in a given round, and ballots are invalid if they are not marked properly (no first preference, or the same candidate selected for multiple preferences).

This application gives users the opportunity to simulate a ranked choice voting election, and to count ballots in a ranked choice voting election, showing ballot by ballot how the outcome is affected.
